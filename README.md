# vue-firebase-starter
This application should give you a ready-made starting point for vue 
and firebase authentication with protected routing for profile view
Before we begin, you will need to create a web app in Firebase [here](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Adding Firebase configuration to the application

Create a configuration file for your application:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit `.env` your web app's Firebase configuration

Next, we need to install our dependencies from npm:


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
